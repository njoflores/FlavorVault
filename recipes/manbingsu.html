            <!-- Ingredients -->
            <h3>Ingredients:</h3>
            <ul class="ingredients-list">
                <li>1 3/4 cup whole milk</li>
                <li>1/3 cup water</li>
                <li>1/3 cup sweetened condensed milk</li>
                <li>3 large mangoes (1.3kg / 2.9 pounds), chilled</li>
                <li>2 tbsp raw sugar</li>
                <li>1 tbsp lemon juice</li>
                <li>Sweetened condensed milk, to taste</li>
                <li>2 scoops vanilla ice cream</li>
                <li>(Optional) Mini mochi (sweet rice cakes)</li>
                <li>(Optional) Philadelphia cheesecake cubes</li>
            </ul>

            <!-- Instructions -->
            <h3>Instructions:</h3>
            <ol class="instructions-list">
                <li>Prepare a large jug. Combine milk, water, and sweetened condensed milk. Stir thoroughly until fully incorporated.</li>
                <li>Pour the milk mixture into a zip-lock bag or ice cube tray. Freeze for at least 6 hours, ensuring the mixture is flat in the bag for easier crushing later.</li>
                <li>Dice the mangoes into small pieces. Keep the visually appealing diced mangoes for topping, and blend the less attractive pieces into a smooth puree.</li>
                <li>In a saucepan, cook the mango puree with raw sugar and lemon juice for 1-2 minutes until the sugar dissolves. Cool the syrup in the fridge.</li>
                <li>To make shaved ice, break up the frozen milk mixture using a pestle or rolling pin if using a zip-lock bag. Alternatively, grind it in a food processor or shaved ice machine for a fine texture.</li>
                <li>Layer the shaved ice in a bowl, followed by mini mochi (optional), sweetened condensed milk, and mango syrup. Repeat the layers and top with diced fresh mango and ice cream. Drizzle more sweetened condensed milk and mango syrup before serving.</li>
            </ol>

            <!-- Tips Section -->
            <h4>Tips:</h4>
            <ul class="tips-list">
                <li>Ensure the milk mixture is fully frozen for at least 6 hours for the perfect shaved ice consistency.</li>
                <li>Use Ataulfo mangoes (also known as honey mangoes) for their creamy texture and less fibrous nature.</li>
                <li>Customize your toppings with mini mochi or cheesecake cubes for a fun texture contrast!</li>
                <li>Chill your serving bowls in the freezer to keep your bingsu cold for longer.</li>
            </ul>
