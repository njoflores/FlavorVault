            <!-- Ingredients -->
            <h3>Ingredients:</h3>
            <ul class="ingredients-list">
                <li>6 large eggs</li>
                <li>1/4 cup (60g) mayonnaise</li>
                <li>2 tsp Dijon mustard</li>
                <li>1 small shallot, peeled and minced</li>
                <li>1 tsp vinegar (white, champagne, or white wine)</li>
                <li>1 tbsp chives, minced (+ extra for garnish)</li>
                <li>1 tbsp flat-leaf parsley, minced</li>
                <li>1/8 tsp freshly ground black pepper</li>
                <li>1/8 tsp salt</li>
                <li>1/2 tsp paprika (hot, sweet, or smoked), for garnish</li>
            </ul>

            <!-- Instructions -->
            <h3>Instructions:</h3>
            <ol class="instructions-list">
                <li><b>Make the hard-boiled eggs:</b><br>
                    Place the eggs in a pot and cover with water, ensuring they’re submerged by at least 1/2 inch. Bring to a firm boil over medium-high heat. Once boiling, turn off the heat, cover the pot, and set a timer for 12 minutes. Once done, transfer the eggs to a bowl of cold water and let them cool.  
                    After cooling, peel the eggs and carefully cut them in half lengthwise, separating the yolks and whites. Set the whites aside.
                </li>

                <li><b>Make the filling:</b><br>
                    In a mixing bowl, combine mayonnaise, Dijon mustard, minced shallot, vinegar, chives, parsley, pepper, and salt. Pass the yolks through a fine-mesh strainer to create a fluffy texture, using the back of a spoon to press them through. Reserve about 2 tablespoons of the fluffy yolks for garnish. Mix the remaining yolks with the mayonnaise mixture and adjust seasoning to taste.
                </li>

                <li><b>Assemble the eggs:</b><br>
                    Spoon or pipe the creamy filling into the hollows of the egg whites. Sprinkle with the reserved fluffy yolks, additional chives, and a dash of paprika for garnish.
                </li>
            </ol>
