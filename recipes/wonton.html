            <!-- Instructions -->
            <h3>Instructions:</h3>
            <ol class="instructions-list">
                <li>In a pot over medium heat, heat oil. Add onions and garlic and cook until aromatic. Add beef and cook until lightly browned.</li>
                <li>Add water and bring to a boil, skimming scum that floats on top. When it clears, add star anise. Add brown sugar and beef bouillon. Stir until dissolved.</li>
                <li>Lower heat, cover, and cook for about 1 to 1 ½ hours or until beef is fork-tender.</li>
                <li>In the meantime, make the wontons. In a bowl, combine ground pork, green onions, garlic, soy sauce, salt, and pepper. Place about 1 teaspoon of the mixture in the center of each wonton wrapper. Wet the edges with water, fold, and press to seal.</li>
                <li>Bring a pot of water to a boil and drop in the wontons. Cook for 3-4 minutes or until they float. Remove with a slotted spoon and set aside.</li>
                <li>Once the beef is cooked, add the Mami noodles to the soup and cook according to the package directions.</li>
                <li>Once the noodles are cooked, add the shredded cabbage and cooked wontons. Simmer for another 2-3 minutes.</li>
                <li>Season with salt and pepper to taste, then serve in bowls topped with fried garlic and chopped green onions.</li>
            </ol>
