                <li>2 cups cooked rice (short grain rice, such as sushi rice)</li>
                <li>1 cup radish kimchi (kkakdugi), cut into small cubes</li>
                <li>100g Spam, diced into small cubes</li>
                <li>1 tbsp cooking oil (rice bran or canola oil)</li>
                <li>20g green onions, thinly sliced</li>
                <li>1 tbsp soy sauce (Kikkoman or Korean yangjo ganjang)</li>
                <li>2 tbsp kimchi juice (preferably from radish kimchi)</li>
                <li>1 tbsp sugar (raw sugar or brown sugar)</li>
                <li>1 tbsp gochujang (Korean chili paste)</li>
                <li>1/4 cup water</li>
                <li>1 tsp sesame oil</li>
                <li>2 eggs (sunny-side up, optional)</li>
                <li>Sesame seeds and seaweed strips for garnish (optional)</li>
            </ul>

            <!-- Instructions -->
            <h3>Instructions:</h3>
            <ol class="instructions-list">
                <li>Prepare your ingredients: Chop the radish kimchi and dice the Spam. If using freshly cooked rice, spread it on a plate to cool and dry for 10 minutes.</li>
                <li>Heat oil in a large skillet or wok over medium-high heat. Add green onions and stir for 30 seconds until fragrant. Add Spam and cook until crispy and golden brown.</li>
                <li>Add the chopped kimchi and sauté for 2-3 minutes until it releases its flavors.</li>
                <li>Pour in the soy sauce, kimchi juice, sugar, gochujang, and water. Stir well to combine.</li>
                <li>Add the cooked rice, breaking up any clumps. Stir-fry and let it sizzle until the rice becomes slightly crispy on the bottom.</li>
                <li>Drizzle sesame oil over the rice and stir to combine. Serve in a bowl, topping with a sunny-side-up egg, sesame seeds, and seaweed strips. Enjoy!</li>
            </ol>

            <!-- Tips Section -->
            <h4>Tips:</h4>
            <ul class="tips-list">
                <li>For the best texture, use day-old rice or spread fresh rice on a tray to cool down.</li>
                <li>Radish kimchi (kkakdugi) adds a crunchy texture that pairs beautifully with the Spam. If you can't find it, feel free to substitute with regular kimchi.</li>
                <li>Customize with proteins like bacon, canned tuna, or even cubed steak for a more upscale version!</li>
                <li>For extra crispiness, let the rice sizzle a bit longer before serving.</li>
            </ul>
