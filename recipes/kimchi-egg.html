            <!-- Instructions -->

            <ol class="instructions-list">
                <li>Crack the eggs directly into a non-stick saucepan. Add butter. Do not beat the eggs or season yet. Turn the heat to medium-high.</li>
                <li>Stir constantly with a spatula, mixing the eggs and butter together.</li>
                <li>When the pan gets hot, remove it from the heat for about 20 seconds, continuing to stir. Return to heat and repeat at 30-second intervals. Cook for 2-4 minutes until the eggs reach a creamy texture.</li>
                <li>Remove from heat and immediately mix in sour cream to stop the eggs from overcooking.</li>
                <li>Add the chopped kale and kimchi. Season with salt and pepper to taste. Serve immediately and enjoy!</li>
            </ol>
