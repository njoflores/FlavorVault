            <!-- Ingredients -->
            <h3>Ingredients:</h3>
            <ul class="ingredients-list">
                <li>2 shots of espresso (2 ounces)</li>
                <li>4 ounces (1/2 cup) fresh whole milk*</li>
            </ul>

            <!-- Instructions -->
            <h3>Instructions:</h3>
            <ol class="instructions-list">
                <li>Make the espresso: Use an espresso machine or manual espresso maker to prepare two shots of espresso. Pour into a mug.</li>
                <li>Steam the milk (espresso machine): Place the milk in a steaming pitcher. Hold the steaming wand just below the surface to create foam until the milk doubles in size. Lower the wand to create silky microfoam with a wet-paint texture. Steam until the milk reaches 150°F (hot but not boiling).</li>
                <li>Froth the milk (no espresso machine): Heat milk to 150°F and froth using a milk frother, French press, or whisk. Aim for small, even bubbles and slightly thickened milk.</li>
                <li>Combine: Tap the milk container on the counter to break large bubbles. Pour steamed or frothed milk into the espresso, ending with a light foam layer on top.</li>
                <li>Serve and enjoy! Customize with your favorite flavor syrups or spices.</li>
            </ol>

            <h4>Tips:</h4>
            <ul class="tips-list">
                <li>Whole milk froths best, but oat milk is a great non-dairy alternative.</li>
                <li>For perfect foam, use fresh milk close to its purchase date.</li>
                <li>Experiment with frothing methods to find what works best for your equipment.</li>
            </ul>
