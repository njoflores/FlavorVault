            <!-- Ingredients -->
            <h3>Ingredients:</h3>
            <ul class="ingredients-list">
                <li>1 cup (250mL) water</li>
                <li>1/3 cup (80g) unsalted butter, cut into small cubes</li>
                <li>1 tsp salt</li>
                <li>¼ tsp nutmeg (freshly grated)</li>
                <li>¼ tsp freshly ground black pepper</li>
                <li>1 ¼ cups (155g) all-purpose flour</li>
                <li>4 large eggs</li>
                <li>¾ cup (75g) grated Gruyère cheese (or aged cheddar)</li>
            </ul>

            <!-- Instructions -->
            <h3>Instructions:</h3>
            <ol class="instructions-list">
                <li>
                    <b>Step 1:</b><br>
                    In a medium saucepan, combine the water, cubed butter, salt, nutmeg, and ground pepper. Cover and bring to a boil. Simmer for 2 minutes. Remove from heat and immediately add in the flour. Stir vigorously with a wooden spoon until a smooth dough forms. Return the saucepan to low heat and keep stirring until the dough ‘dries out’ and pulls away from the pan, about 2 minutes.
                </li>

                <li>
                    <b>Step 2:</b><br>
                    Remove from the heat again and let cool for 1 minute. Beat the eggs thoroughly into the dough, one at a time. It is important that each egg is fully incorporated into the batter before adding the next egg. If the dough separates, keep beating and it will come together again.
                </li>

                <li>
                    <b>Step 3:</b><br>
                    Using a piping bag or a cookie scoop (or two spoons), drop tablespoon-sized balls of dough on the baking sheets, keeping them one inch apart. Sprinkle about half a tablespoon of grated Gruyère on top of each ball.
                </li>

                <li>
                    <b>Step 4:</b><br>
                    Bake for 30-35 minutes at 390°F (200°C), until puffed and golden. Enjoy warm!
