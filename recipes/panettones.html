                <li>1/2 teaspoon nutmeg</li>

                <h4>For Dusting:</h4>
                <li>Confectioners’ sugar</li>
            </ul>

            <!-- Instructions -->
            <h3>Instructions:</h3>
            <ol class="instructions-list">
                <li>Begin by activating the yeast. Dissolve one tablespoon of sugar in lukewarm water and sprinkle the yeast over it. Allow it to bloom for about 10 minutes until frothy.</li>
                <li>Warm the milk and add the vanilla extract to it. The temperature should be warm to the touch but not hot.</li>
                <li>In the bowl of a stand mixer, cream the butter and sugar until light and fluffy.</li>
                <li>Add the eggs, one at a time, beating well after each addition. Add the yeast mixture, then the flour and salt, alternating with the milk, until the dough comes together.</li>
                <li>Knead the dough in the stand mixer for 10 minutes until smooth and elastic. Then transfer to a greased bowl, cover with a towel, and let it rise for 2 hours, or until doubled in size.</li>
                <li>Once risen, punch down the dough and knead in the dried fruit and pear.</li>
                <li>Divide the dough into mini panettone molds, filling them about two-thirds of the way full. Allow them to rise again for another hour.</li>
                <li>Preheat the oven to 350°F (175°C). Bake for 20-25 minutes, or until golden brown and a skewer inserted into the center comes out clean.</li>
                <li>Cool the panettones on a wire rack before dusting with confectioners’ sugar.</li>
            </ol>

            <h3>Making the Mulled Wine Sauce:</h3>
            <ol class="instructions-list">
                <li>In a saucepan, combine all the ingredients for the mulled wine sauce.</li>
                <li>Bring the mixture to a simmer over medium heat.</li>
                <li>Reduce the heat to low and continue to simmer for about 15-20 minutes, until the sauce thickens and the spices have infused the wine.</li>
                <li>Strain the sauce to remove the solids, and it’s ready to be poured over your warm panettones.</li>
            </ol>
