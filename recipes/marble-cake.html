                <li>1 cup (200g) sugar</li>

                <li>¼ tsp kosher salt</li>
                <li>¼ cups (60g) milk (2% m.f or whole)</li>
                <li>2 tsp (8.5ml) vanilla extract</li>

            </ul>

            <!-- Instructions -->
            <h3>Instructions:</h3>
            <ol class="instructions-list">
                <li>
                    <b>Step 1:</b><br>
                    Preheat the oven to 390°F (200°C). Grease a 9x5-inch loaf pan with butter and dust it with flour.
                </li>

                <li>
                    <b>Step 2:</b><br>
                    Using a spatula or whisk, cream the butter and sugar together until light and fluffy. Add the eggs and mix until well incorporated.
                </li>

                <li>
                    <b>Step 3:</b><br>
                    In a separate bowl, sift together the flour, baking powder, baking soda, and salt. Combine this dry mixture with the wet ingredients and mix until just incorporated. Add the milk and mix again until just combined.
                </li>

                <li>
                    <b>Step 4:</b><br>
                    Divide the batter into two bowls. In one bowl, stir in the vanilla extract. In the second bowl, stir in the cocoa powder and 1 tbsp of milk.
                </li>

                <li>
                    <b>Step 5:</b><br>
                    Using a large spoon, dollop about 1/3 of a cup of the vanilla batter into the prepared pan and spread it evenly along the bottom. Dollop the same amount of chocolate batter in the middle, spreading it out while leaving some vanilla batter visible around the edges. Alternate layers of vanilla and chocolate until all the batter is used. To create marbling, run a sharp knife through the batter vertically along the length of your loaf pan, forming an "S" shape.
                </li>

                <li>
                    <b>Step 6:</b><br>
                    Bake for 10 minutes at 390°F (200°C). Then, reduce the temperature to 350°F (180°C) and bake for another 40 minutes, or until a cake tester comes out clean.
                </li>

                <li>
                    <b>Step 7:</b><br>
                    Let the cake cool on a rack for at least 15 minutes before removing it from the pan and slicing.
                </li>
