            <!-- Ingredients -->
            <h3>Ingredients:</h3>
            <ul class="ingredients-list">
                <li>9 grams espresso roast coffee for a single shot, 18 grams for a double shot</li>
                <li>Espresso machine (or alternative methods listed below)</li>
                <li>Knock box (optional, for tamping and discarding used grounds)</li>
            </ul>

            <!-- Instructions -->
            <h3>Instructions:</h3>
            <ol class="instructions-list">
                <li>Grind the coffee: Use espresso roast coffee and grind it very finely. Adjust the grind for your specific machine if necessary.</li>
                <li>Pack and tamp the coffee grounds: Add the coffee grounds into the espresso basket (portafilter), slightly heaping. Use a tamper to press them evenly and firmly.</li>
                <li>Pull the shot: Place the portafilter into the espresso machine and start the shot. A well-pulled shot takes 25-30 seconds and results in a rich, creamy crema.</li>
                <li>Consider adjustments: If the shot is watery, use more coffee grounds or a finer grind. If the shot takes longer than 30 seconds, reduce the amount of coffee grounds or use a coarser grind.</li>
            </ol>

            <!-- Tips Section -->
            <h4>Tips:</h4>
            <ul class="tips-list">
                <li>Practice makes perfect: it may take a few tries to get the grind and tamping just right.</li>
                <li>Invest in a good espresso machine for the best results, but portable espresso makers can still yield decent espresso.</li>
                <li>If you're new to espresso, consider buying pre-ground espresso for easier preparation.</li>
            </ul>
