                <li>When it begins to set, gently fold with tomatoes and onions until combined.</li>
                <li>Continue to cook until eggs are just set but still slightly wet.</li>

            <h4>Pro Tips:</h4>
            <ul class="tips-list">
                <li>Whisk the eggs very well to aerate and create lighter, fluffier curds.</li>
                <li>Cook the eggs at low heat to avoid them becoming hard and dry.</li>
                <li>Turn off the heat while the eggs are still slightly wet, as they will continue to cook with the residual heat from the pan.</li>
            </ul>
