                These fluffy little potato pancakes, known as "Crêpes Vonnassiennes" or "Crêpes Parmentières", come from Vonnas, in the Auvergne-Rhone-Alpes region of France. Created by Mère Blanc, grandmother of Michelin-star Chef Georges Blanc, these pancakes are made with mashed potatoes, milk, and eggs, cooked in a pan to create a delicate and delicious dish.

            <h3>Ingredients:</h3>
            <ul class="ingredients-list">
                <li>1 pound (500g) potatoes, peeled</li>
                <li>Salt, to taste</li>
                <li>3 tbsp all-purpose flour</li>
                <li>3 medium eggs + 4 egg whites</li>
                <li>2 tbsp crème fraîche (or sour cream)</li>
            </ul>

            <ol class="instructions-list">
                <li>
                    <b>Step 1:</b><br>
                    Boil the potatoes with a pinch of salt in a large pot of water until tender. Drain and mash them until smooth but thick. Set aside to cool.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <b>Step 2:</b><br>
                    Once the mashed potatoes have cooled a bit, add the flour and mix until just incorporated. Then, add the eggs, egg whites, and crème fraîche. Stir until the batter is smooth and custard-like in consistency (not too liquidy).
                </li>
                <li>
                    <b>Step 3:</b><br>
                    Heat a frying pan over medium-low heat and melt a bit of butter. Ladle a small amount of the batter into the pan. Cook for 2-3 minutes, until bubbles form. Flip and cook for another minute until golden. Repeat with the remaining batter.
