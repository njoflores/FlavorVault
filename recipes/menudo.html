            <!-- Instructions -->
            <h3>Instructions:</h3>
            <ol class="instructions-list">
                <li>In a bowl, combine pork, soy sauce, calamansi juice, and pepper. Marinate for 10 to 15 minutes.</li>
                <li>In a large pan, heat about ¼ cup oil. Add potatoes and carrots and cook until lightly browned. Remove from the pan and set aside.</li>
                <li>Remove excess oil except for about two tablespoons. Add bell peppers and cook on high heat for about 30 to 40 seconds. Remove from the pan and drain on paper towels.</li>
                <li>Add hotdogs and cook until lightly browned. Remove and set aside.</li>
                <li>Add more oil to the pan as needed. Sear the liver just until lightly browned. Remove and set aside.</li>
                <li>In the same pan, add oil as needed. Add onions and garlic and cook until softened.</li>
                <li>Drain the marinated pork well, reserving marinade. Add to the pan and cook until lightly browned.</li>
                <li>Add tomato paste and cook for about 1 minute, stirring until evenly distributed.</li>
                <li>Add the reserved marinade, tomato sauce, and water. Stir to distribute and bring to a boil, skimming scum that floats on top. Lower heat, cover, and simmer for about 35 to 45 minutes or until the pork is tender and sauce is slightly reduced.</li>
                <li>Add potatoes, carrots, hotdogs, garbanzos, raisins, and green peas. Continue to cook until potatoes and carrots are tender.</li>
                <li>Add liver and let stand for a few seconds before stirring. Continue to simmer until cooked through.</li>
                <li>Add bell peppers. Season with Maggi Magic Sarap.</li>
                <li>Continue to cook until the sauce is reduced and slightly thickened.</li>
            </ol>

            <!-- Tips Section -->
            <h4>Pro Tips:</h4>
            <ul class="tips-list">
                <li>Cut the meat and other ingredients into even-sized pieces to ensure uniform doneness.</li>
                <li>Sear the liver just until lightly browned, as it will continue to cook when added to the stew. Overcooking will make it tough and dry.</li>
            </ul>

            <!-- Serving Suggestions and Storage -->
            <h4>Serving Suggestions and Storage:</h4>
            <ul class="tips-list">
                <li>Serve with steamed rice, or use as a filling for pandesal rolls or empanada pies.</li>
                <li>The stew stores well and actually tastes better after a day or two. Transfer to an airtight container and refrigerate for up to 3 days or freeze for up to 2 months.</li>
                <li>To reheat, place in a saucepan over medium heat, adding water or broth to adjust the consistency as needed. Alternatively, microwave at 2 to 3-minute intervals until heated through, stirring between intervals.</li>
