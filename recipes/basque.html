            <!-- Ingredients -->
            <h3>Ingredients:</h3>
            <ul class="ingredients-list">
                <li>500g cream cheese (Philadelphia recommended)</li>
                <li>220g whisked eggs (approx. 4–5 large eggs)</li>
                <li>250ml whipping cream</li>
                <li>150g caster sugar</li>
                <li>10g all-purpose flour</li>
                <li>1 tsp vanilla extract or bean paste</li>
            </ul>

            <!-- Instructions -->
            <h3>Instructions:</h3>
            <ol class="instructions-list">
                <li>Preheat your oven to 220°C (425°F) or 200°C (fan-forced). Line a 6cm-deep cake pan with scrunched baking paper for the classic rustic look.</li>
                <li>Beat the cream cheese until smooth using a hand mixer. Add sugar and beat until just combined.</li>
                <li>In a separate bowl, whisk the flour with a small amount of cream to form a lump-free paste. Gradually add the rest of the cream and vanilla, whisking until smooth.</li>
                <li>Slowly add the cream mixture to the cream cheese while beating on low speed. Stop mixing as soon as combined.</li>
                <li>Gradually add the whisked eggs while beating on low speed. Stop as soon as incorporated to avoid bubbles.</li>
                <li>Pour the batter into the lined pan. Tap the pan on the counter to release air bubbles, then pop visible bubbles with a knife.</li>
                <li>Bake for 45–65 minutes until the surface is deeply golden brown and the center jiggles like jelly. Adjust the time based on your oven.</li>
                <li>Cool at room temperature for 2 hours, then refrigerate uncovered for at least 8 hours or overnight.</li>
                <li>Slice and serve. No toppings needed – the cheesecake shines on its own!</li>
            </ol>

            <!-- Tips Section -->
            <h4>Tips:</h4>
            <ul class="tips-list">
                <li>Use full-fat cream cheese and whipping cream for the best texture and flavor.</li>
                <li>Measure your eggs carefully – the balance is key to achieving the perfect consistency.</li>
                <li>Refrigerate uncovered to avoid condensation and preserve the cheesecake's shiny surface.</li>
            </ul>
