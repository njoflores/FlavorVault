            <ul class="ingredients-list">
                <li>2 packs (250 ml each) all-purpose cream, very cold</li>
                <li>1 can (14 ounces) condensed milk, very cold</li>
                <li>18 pieces graham crackers</li>

            <!-- Instructions -->
            <h3>Instructions:</h3>
            <ol class="instructions-list">
                <li>In a large bowl, combine all-purpose cream and condensed milk. Using a hand mixer at low speed, beat mixture until it begins to thicken. Increase speed to medium and continue to beat for about 8 to 10 minutes or until double in volume.</li>
                <li>Arrange one layer of graham crackers on the bottom of the pan, breaking pieces as needed to fit sides.</li>
                <li>Spoon ⅓ of the cream mixture on graham crackers and spread to cover.</li>
                <li>Arrange fruit cocktail on top of the cream.</li>
                <li>Arrange another layer of graham crackers over the fruit.</li>
                <li>Spoon and spread ⅓ of the cream mixture. Add another layer of fruit.</li>
                <li>Arrange the last layer of graham crackers on top of the fruit. Spoon and spread remaining ⅓ of the cream mixture on top of crackers. Arrange the remaining fruit cocktail on top of the cream.</li>
                <li>Cover tightly with plastic film and refrigerate overnight. Freeze for about 1 hour before serving, if you like.</li>
                <li>To serve, cut into squares.</li>
            </ol>

            <!-- Tips Section -->
            <h4>Pro Tips:</h4>
            <ul class="tips-list">
                <li>For maximum volume, chill the cream and condensed milk until very cold. You can also chill the bowl and the beaters in the freezer for about 20 to 30 minutes.</li>
                <li>Drain the canned fruit well to keep the extra liquid from seeping into the cake.</li>
                <li>Cover tightly with plastic wrap, pressing the film on the surface of the top cake layer to prevent ice crystals.</li>
            </ul>
